### Purpose
This is a horror themed website advertising a plush of a cute baby chicken. This is an upgraded one for the project for freecodecamp.org certificate in responsive web devlopment. However, because I use bootstrap which is an already responsive, I did not use @media in css which will not pass the project checklist unlike the original page i created.

### Inspiration
The product is inspired by a macabun plush (https://pwuffy.com/products/macabunny-plush). However, this product is not as it seems--it's somewhat cursed. I have not been able to develop a game lately so this is kind of a compromise, emulating a cursed website and product. I love the horror element. The website design is inspired by samsung web page (https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/). I like the minimalistic yet future design of the website. It's funny that a plush can be showcased similar to a tech product. 

### Ideas for future me
- make it so that when you scroll to horror section, add very subtle background noise and turn it off when it's on the "normal" part of the website.

### Progress
1. I had to create a 3d model of a plush inspired by the samsung s24 ultra phone. I thought it would look more proffessional funnily enough. I created in paint3d because i dont feel like downloading blender right now. So I could not change the material to make it looks soft and fluffy, it looks like a digitally created 3d object. Design took hours for some reason until i was satisfied.

2. I saved plush into images in various background colors to make it look cute. The pastel and light colors are again inspired by macabuns. It also serves as a setup as the horror part of the website are in nether red and dark night black.

3. Finally I created a video because it was part of the requirement of the project to embed a video into the website. I was going to create one where the camera zooms into the plush and have texts all over the screen saying it will make you happy ["you are happy", "you will be happy", you shall be happy", "may you obtain happiness", "you must be happy?","are you happy"] fly all over the screen with creepy music background. But paint3d had a preset animation that hovers the 3d object which is creepy on its own so i used that instead and used microsoft clipcamp to add creepy ambiance noise. I eneded up choosing vhs tape suspended noise.

4. I wanted to use this project to practice using jquery and bootstrap. Jquery made it so much shoter, quicker, and easier to code.

5. I thought using bootstrap would accerlate my work flow however, I think it was about the same. I was doing so much thinking looking at the examples provided with each component avaiable. It look me a long time to figure out if a class is required or not. I assumed it does because that is how they are able to style. So I ended up using bootstrap as a template. It felt like kind of cheapting. However, since I have coded dropdown menus, responsive nav, and button to collapse divs before it did not feel that bad. I reminds of me of game devloping using the unreal engine which is blueprint based. so I still had to do customization in css.

6. I will work on how it looks on mobile later. I also did not change the fonts so it looks kind of basic. I want it more cute themed abd the horror part intensified.

7. I made it so the mobile version is more presentable however the redner is blurry in the first place. I do not know why saving directly from paint 3d as an image file is this blurry.
